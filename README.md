# flexdeploypoc
Proof-of-concept for integrating FlexDeploy with Github

This project is intended to be a simple project that contains:
1. Some Java web applications built using maven
2. Simple Oracle Fusion OSB project and BPEL project 
3. Sample/simple WebLogic WLST jython scripts
 
This is created for a lab exercise to be performed to kick the tires of FlexDeploy

The plan is to take the sample application provided by Oracle WebLogic server and make slight modifications. As we plan to support both Java EE and Spring applications, we may use two different projects for the lab.
